## Why
Since I moved to São Paulo to work at **Riachulo Stores Tech**, I started adding some new technologies and frameworks to my "tool box".  
Some of that I only tried one or two times. So after some time, I forget some details, and would be nice to have some content, write by myself to refresh my mind about theese technologies, like Node-Red, for example.

Also, I'd like to share my knowledge and experiences I've been passing through my day-to-day life as a **Technical Leader**.
## Where
At first, I tried medium.com. But I wrote only one post in eight months. Obviously it didn't catch me.  
I'd like something more personal...  
Well, last week I was asked to leave my team for a while to support another team that is in a very important business strategic project.  
The frontend of this project is been build upon `Next.js` framework. A framework that wraps `React.js` for supporting Static Generation, Server Side Rendering, Client Side Rendering. I'm proficient in React.js but never wrote a simple Hello World with Next.js.  
So, as I usually do, I begun with the "Start Learning" of [Next.js official website](https://nextjs.org/).  
As result, I got a simple blog built and realized that it's what I needed:
- My personal website that I can customize with JavaScrip and React.js, what I like much more than using `Jerkyll` for `GitHub Pages`, for example;
- And for blog posts, I can use `Markdown`, really easy since I'm used to write README's for git projects.

## Why English?
I'm used to read a lot of content in English, but I'm no used to write. So, let's practice Englsh writing skills.

From now, I will force me the discipline to post regularly.
