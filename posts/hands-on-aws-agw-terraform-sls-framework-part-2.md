Hi, everyone!
For this "Hands on!" we're building a REST API with **AWS API Gateway**, provisioned with **Terraform** and backed by **AWS Lambda** built with **Serverless Framework**.  
The REST API will allow us to send SMS Messages using **AWS SNS**. Sounds like a lot of things, 
but it's not that lot of working.  
For this part 2, we'll code the backend with Serverless Framework and for part 1 and 3:

## About the tech stack
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/): Most popular Cloud provider. You need an account to follow this article properly;
- [AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/): AWS managed API Gateway that will expose our rest endpoints;
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): serverless functions on AWS working as our backend;
- [AWS SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/): AWS Simple Notification Service that, among other types of notifications, allow us to send SMS for a phone number;
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/): IaC (Infrastructure as Code) tool that allow us to provision cloud resources supporting several cloud providers;
- [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/): a Framework for support building and deploying serverless functions grouped as a Serverless Service, allowing also the provisioning of resources need for these functions;
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/): JS runtime where our JavaScript lambda functions going to be running;
- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): Of course, the programing language we'll write our lambda.

### Serverless Framework
The purpose of [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com) is to provide a framework 
development, test, build, deploy and secure serverless applications, grouping functions in a service. Supporting several Cloud Providers as well.

Install it following instructions on https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started and...
Hands on!

### Setting project
For create a project from a template for AWS + NodeJS, run on terminal:
```sh
$ sls create --template aws-nodejs
```  
Note the `serverless.yml` file. It's the configuration file of the service. Here we can also set resources provision we might need as DynamoDB tables, SNS topics and so on.
The file has a lot of commented lines, so let's clean it and leave it like this:

```yml
service: sms-sender-api

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  apiGateway:
    restApiId: wvnnv69jzf
    restApiRootResourceId: 0s0ivf
  region: us-east-1

functions: # defines a function (Lambda since AWS are our provider)
  hello:
    handler: handler.hello # JavaScript function that will handle the event generated for a call to this function
    events:
      - http: # We're defining that the function is triggered by an http call
          method: POST # the http method for the http call
          path: /sms # the api resource path

package:
  # excludes are added first
  exclude:
    - .vscode/**
    - .editorconfig
    - .terraform
    - terraform.*
    - .env
    - .env.**
    - .gitignore
    - .git
    - README.md
    - yarn.log
    - yarn.lock
    - package-lock.json
    - .prettierrc
    - .eslintrc.js
```

`provider.apiGateway.restApiId` and `provider.apiGateway.restApiRootResourceId`: references for 
the API and the resource path that should be a parent of any resource paths created by this 
service, respectively.  
  We can look for it on the API in the AWS Console like this:  
![](../images/posts/hands-on-aws-agw-terraform-sls-framework-part-2/aws_api_gateway_id.png)

Now let's deploy this to AWS running:
```sh
$ sls deploy
```

If everything is ok, we should see on API Console the new resources `/sms` with a POST method.  
We can test it with Postman ou directly on Console:  
![](../images/posts/hands-on-aws-agw-terraform-sls-framework-part-2/aws_api_gateway_sms_test.png)

Once it's working, let's code the handler to send the SMS using Amazon SNS.  
To do that, we need to start the NPM Package Manager and install the AWS SDK:
```sh
$ npm init && npm i aws-sdk --save
```
The `handler.js` file should be like this:  
```javascript
const AWS = require("aws-sdk");

module.exports.hello = async (event) => {
    AWS.config.update({ region: "us-east-1" });
    try {
        const { phoneNumber, message } = JSON.parse(event.body);
        await new AWS.SNS({ apiVersion: "2010-03-31" })
            .publish({ Message: message, PhoneNumber: `+55${phoneNumber}` })
            .promise();
        return {
            statusCode: 201,
            body: JSON.stringify(
                {
                    message: "SMS sent!",
                },
                null,
                2
            ),
        };
    } catch (error) {
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify(error),
        };
    }
};
```

The last thing is to allow the Lambda to access Amazon SNS changing `serverless.yml`:  
```yml
# serverless.yml
...
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs12.x
  apiGateway:
    restApiId: xxxxxxxx
    restApiRootResourceId: xxxxx
  region: us-east-1
  iamManagedPolicies:
    - 'arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonSNSFullAccess'...
```

Testing the api again, this time passing the JSON below, an SMS should be sent to the phone number.
```json
{
    "phoneNumber": "11912345678",
    "message": "testing api"
}
```

<br />

That's it for this post. In part 3 we're implement authentication with Amazon Cognito:
