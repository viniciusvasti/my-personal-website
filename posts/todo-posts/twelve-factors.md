## About the tech stack
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/): serverless functions on AWS working as our backend;

### A Post Session

Ex: endpoint X points to a serverless function, endpoint Y points to Java Spring Boot Microservice, endpoint Z points to third-party API.  

So, hands on!
