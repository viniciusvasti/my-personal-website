Hi, everyone!
This is the start of a series with no end (because I'm always learning new things, and I'll try them 
out on this series).  
I'm going to put in practice some knowledge about Software Engineering/Architecture, DevOps, SRE...  
The motivations for this are:
- Show hard skills;
- Build a git repository of a modern and complete project;
- Put in practice some concepts I know (like DevOps), but I have not opportunity to use in my job;
- Share knowledge with other developers and the future me haha.

This post will be fixed on top of posts' list, and it's going to be updated whenever a new post of 
the series is released.

### What I'm going to build
I will be building a microservices based System for supporting an unreal online store to sale it's products.
I may or may not build a simple PWA to emulate the store's web app.
The architecture should be modern, scalable, observable, secure and fault tolerant.
